To generate figures to display proteomics data (violin plots, volcano plots, heat maps) the ERphagy_FigureGeneration_GithubV2 file was used, for Figure 1 must import file ss_organelle_list2_wh_annotation_cytoAddedBasedGO_ERannotation.csv for other figures and to ensure complete list of ER membrane proteins import ss_organelle_list2_wh_annotation_cytoAddedBasedGO_ERannotation2.csv

For a second proteomics data analysis (to generate random selections of proteins and test how these random selections compare to protein lists of interest) the Scriptforrandomselectioncomparision file was used. 

To generate plots for cryo-ET analysis the ERphagy_iNeurons_cryoET_plots.ipynb was used. This was created by cptcst.
